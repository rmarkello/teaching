<b>Results clinic</b>: The result clinic will be a 1 or 2 hour activity where groups of 5 students
or less will discuss their project results under the supervision of an instructor.
They will present their results to each other in a structured but informal way
and will exchange ideas about them. Students are expected to prepare key figures,
tables, etc. about their results but no formal presentation. Discussion will be
about the content of the results and their presentation. 

<b>Presentation clinic</b>: The presentation clinic will be a 1 or 2 hour activity where groups of 5 students
or less will discuss the current status of their project presentation, under the
supervision of an instructor. It will be an opportunity for students to receive
feedback on their presentation ahead of the final one. The instructors will also
provide some tips-and-tricks for making effective presentations.

<b>Unconference</b>: Students and instructors will propose short, focused presentations on
something they learned during the school, which was not a direct piece of the
curriculum, and could benefit other attendees, such as a tool, a method, a dataset, etc.
Topics could be suggested from a few days before. Detailed program will be announced on Wednesday morning.

<b>Writing clinic</b>: The writing clinic will be a 1 or 2 hour activity where groups of 5 students
or less will discuss the current status of their reports. They will cross-review 
each other’s report and exchange feedback, with the supervision of an instructor.
It will be an opportunity for students to receive feedback on their reports before 
the final submission.
