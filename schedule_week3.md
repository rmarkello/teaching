This week will be devoted to science communication. The assignment for this week is for students to produce a 3-minute video based on their project. The video is directed at a general audience, and could incorporate slides, talking heads, animations, or other formats that the students want to experiment with. Unless otherwise specified, sessions will take place in room L7660 of the Lassonde Pavilion at École Polytechnique.
